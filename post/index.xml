      <description>The last four decades have seen vital changes in women’s political participation and in the degree to which gender vividly restricts women’s opportunities in the public sector (governance). Insights gained from the general social survey (GSS, fepol 1974-2018)) shows a yearly shift in the belief about whether men are more suited in politics than women. However, since 2000-2018, a significant percentage of people believe that men are not more suited for politics than women.</description>
